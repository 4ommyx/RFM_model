# K-Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation

This project applies **K-Means Clustering**, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. The primary objective is to extract actionable insights to support **targeted marketing strategies** and **enhance customer engagement**.

## Project Objective

The main goal is to segment customers based on the **RFM model**:

- **Recency** â€“ How recently a customer made a purchase  
- **Frequency** â€“ How often they purchase  
- **Monetary Value** â€“ How much they spend  

These segments help businesses to:

- Deliver **personalized promotions**
- **Increase sales** through targeted offerings
- Build **long-term customer loyalty**

## ðŸ“Š Overview of K-Means Clustering

**K-Means** is an iterative algorithm that partitions data into *K* distinct, non-overlapping clusters based on feature similarity. The general steps include:

1. Select the number of clusters (**K**)
2. Initialize **centroids** randomly
3. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid
4. Recalculate centroids based on current cluster members
5. Repeat steps 3â€“4 until convergence is reached (i.e., centroids do not change significantly)

## ðŸ§¾ Dataset Description

The dataset includes transactional data with the following attributes:

| Column       | Description                                         |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| InvoiceNo    | Unique invoice number (cancellations start with â€˜Câ€™)|
| StockCode    | Product/item code                                   |
| Description  | Product name                                        |
| Quantity     | Number of items purchased                           |
| InvoiceDate  | Date of transaction                                 |
| UnitPrice    | Price per item (Â£)                                  |
| CustomerID   | Unique identifier for each customer                 |
| Country      | Country where the transaction was made              |

## Analysis and Insights

By applying K-Means to the processed RFM features, we identified **distinct customer segments**, such as:

- **High spenders** with low purchase frequency  
- **Frequent buyers** with lower spending  
- **Loyal and consistent** customers  

These clusters help businesses to:

- Target the right customers with the right promotions  
- Increase ROI through focused marketing efforts  
- Develop customer-centric strategies that foster loyalty
